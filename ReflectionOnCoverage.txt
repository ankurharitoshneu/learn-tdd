Reflection on 100% Coverage
Achieving 100% test coverage ensures all lines, branches, and functions in your code are executed during tests, offering confidence in code reliability and uncovering untested areas. However, it does not guarantee bug-free software or logical correctness, as coverage measures execution, not quality.

Key Points:

Benefits: Encourages comprehensive testing, aids refactoring, and increases confidence in the codebase.

Limitations: Can lead to meaningless tests, ignores performance issues, and may miss real-world scenarios.

Balanced Approach: Focus on testing critical paths, edge cases, and error handling. Prioritize meaningful assertions and complement unit tests with integration tests.

Coverage is a tool for confidence, not the sole measure of code quality. Aim for meaningful tests over achieving a perfect percentage.
